Run the application RequestTimer.py and follow the promts.
The application asks for the times formatted as follows HH:MM:SS separated by commas.
It can be pasted in or a file containing them can be selected.
The Input times will be put into the scheduler to be performed on the current day at the times. Times in the past will be ignored, and invalid inputs will be ignored.
The get requests will be performed at the times specified, and the output data is output to output.txt as json.
